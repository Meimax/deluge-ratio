* Now with WebUI support!

Ever wanted to track your total uploads, downloads, and overall share
ratio in [[http://deluge-torrent.org/][Deluge]]?

Now you can!

The status bar format is simple:

   share ratio = (total uploads / total downloads)

* Installation
Before installing, it is probably a good idea to check that you have
the latest version of Deluge installed.
** Installing a Release Egg (easiest)
1. Go to [[https://github.com/PhasecoreX/deluge-ratio/releases][releases]].
2. Download the latest release egg.
3. In Deluge go to ~Preferences -> Plugins~, click ~Install plugin~,
   then find where you downloaded the egg and select it.
** Build an Egg
On Linux, clone this git repo and run ~./distribute.sh~.
* Preferences
** Save download and upload totals on quit
By default you save your download and upload totals across Deluge
sessions.

Your totals are also saved about once a minute so you shouldn't lose
much of your totals data if Deluge or the computer suddenly crashes.
** Reset download and totals
If you want to start your totals from scratch, click this button.
* Development
On Linux, run ~./create_dev_link.sh~ which will create a link file in
your Deluge plugins folder. This way you can work on the plugin
without having to reinstall it to test every change.

However you still have to restart Deluge to test latest changes.
* Future
- Add option to hide ratio upload/download totals.
* License
GPLv3, yo!
